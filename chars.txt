(This is the instruction list, defined in a more machine-readable
format. The first character is the instruction, and the second
word is what it will be defined as after it is parsed. The braces
{} after control characters mean that instruction has a body.
This file currently only has the minimal amount of characters to
test it, and more should be added later. Do not end this file
with a newline.)
